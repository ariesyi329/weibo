#Kit Chan: I am a singer
After 2nd Jan, [`Kit Chan`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit_Chan)'s first show on the stage of [`I AM A SINGER`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Singer_(Chinese_TV_series)), she catched fans' eyes at [`Weibo`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sina_Weibo) (China's Twitter) due to the shockingly low votes for her sound of heaven. A week later, Kit was out of the competition. And it sparked a hot discussion about quality over popularity.

Kit Chan, 42, is the first Singaporean singer in the contest. Even though honored as Singapore's "national treasure", in this stage, she is much more obscurity among the Chinese audience, compared to her competitors such as Hong Kong's [`Leo Ku`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Ku) and China's [`Han Hong`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Hong_(singer)). Her elimination may because of the lower popularity.

After the elimination, one fan worte: "We love her; we must revive her!" Many other fans followed and commented under her weibo. They chose emoticons to express their feelings: `love u, heart, flowers` for supporting; `good, like, applause, awesome` for encouraging; `cry, shy` for sadness; etc.

However, as Kit said, "I am not playing to win. I know the song I chose and my performing style aren't really for the competition. I hope that through my performance, the audience in China and in other places can fall in love." Despite this setback, Kit Chan is winning audiences' hearts and her popularity have begun to rise in China. Now, her fans in China are typically from Guangdong, Sichuan and Beijing.
